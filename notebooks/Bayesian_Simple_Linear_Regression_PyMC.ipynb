        "The precursor to all blazing wildfires in remote areas, such as forests or mountainsides, are three elements often referred to as the “fire triangle”: heat, fuel, and oxygen (BC Public Service, 2023). The “heat” represents the ignition source of the fire, such as a lightning strike or irresponsible human activity, while the “fuel” generally refers to organic matter that can keep the fire burning, such as dry grass, trees, or shrubs (BC Public Service, 2023). Oxygen, or more specifically wind speeds, is often what determines the rate of spread and which direction a fire is burning (BC Public Service, 2023)."

        "Given the physical relationship between fires, fuel, and wind speeds, is it then reasonable to say that we can use one of these factors alone, such as wind speed, as a basis to make decisions, such as where to deploy emergency personnel? What we mean by this question is that if we, for example, knew in advance that a region would be expecting high winds during a summer period, would it be reasonable to expend resources and make decisions in that area in anticipation of a raging wildfire?\n",
        "\n",
        "During the wildfire season, key decisions like these can often be the difference between life and death, forests burning, or properties being destroyed. For example, utility companies may have to make decisions on whether certain power lines need to be shut off during blustery days if there’s a significant risk of sparking a wildfire. Insurance companies might also be able to set fairer risk premiums if they can create better models for fire-prone areas or notify their portfolio properties during high-risk events. And then, of course, there are governments and fire management agencies that can take proactive approaches, such as planning evacuations or suppression tactics and proactively doing prescribed burns to reduce the risk of uncontrollable wildfires.\n",

        "To find out whether we can use wind speeds alone as a reliable variable for predicting fire size (total hectares burnt in a wildfire), one strategy we utilize is a mathematical model you’ve likely touched on in high school - a Simple Linear Regression. A linear model like **Simple Linear Regression**, often described by the mathematical formula: $y = mx + b$, is great because it allows us to understand and predict the relationship between two variables, one being the **independent variable ($x$)** and the other known as the **dependent variable ($y$)**. In machine learning circles where we typically lurk in, these variables are also referred to as the **predictor variable ($x$)** and the **target variable ($y$)**, which we’ll stick to for the rest of this article. Given some data about these two variables, what a Simple Linear Regression does is generate a straight line that best fits through the scatterplot of the data, just like we have in *Figure 1*."

        "Great! Now that we’ve had the chance to review the basics of Linear Regression, let’s level up our understanding by adding the Bayesian interpretation of this concept. In a [previous article](https://pub.towardsai.net/why-most-introductory-examples-of-bayesian-statistics-misrepresent-it-d2e12ac69278), we wrote about how Bayesian methods distinguish themselves as a separate branch of statistics owing to the fact that it *considers the full range of possible outcomes in the form of probability distributions* to model relationships. So when building a linear regression model to determine whether wind speeds predict fire size, a Bayesian model would consider every combination of our parameter values - slope ($m$) and y-intercept ($b$). Through our parameter values, we can apply a key principle of Bayesian Statistics, which is to incorporate our **prior beliefs** on what these probability distributions might be. In other words, what information about wind speed or fire size do we already know based on our understanding of the natural world that we can then encode in a probability distribution for our model?\n",
        "\n",
        "By incorporating the full range of possibilities in our model, we’re then able to quantify the model’s uncertainty in its predictions, which wouldn’t have been possible if we had only generated a single regression line. Instead, we can test all plausible combinations of parameter values against our collected data to produce a posterior distribution *for each individual mean predictor value*, which effectively generates hundreds (or thousands, depending on the dataset size) of regression lines, thus giving us a fuller understanding of the relationship between wind speed and fire size.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another key aspect of Bayesian Linear Models is that they are especially useful in circumstances where we have access to limited data, although this isn’t a challenge we’re currently constrained with. Since we’re able to encode our hypothesis on the relationship between our predictor and target variable, our prior knowledge can make up for the lack of data. As we continue to fit our Bayesian model on new data, theoretically, over time, the model updates itself to better model the relationship.\n",

Line 1 can be read as “the logarithm (with 1 added to remove mathematical issues with zeroes) of the total spread of each individual fire ($i$) in our dataset is distributed as (this is what the $\\sim$ symbol indicates) a normal, or bell-curved, distribution based on its mean and standard deviation value.\n",

        "\n",
        "Similar to the log transformation we did in Line 1, we use Line 3 to define our predictor value ($x_i$) as the log-transformed wind speed, where we add 1 before taking the logarithm to handle cases where wind speed might be zero (since `log(0)` is undefined).\n",

        "However, in Lines 5 & 6, we break from conventional Gaussian distributions by using Half-Normal distributions that only allow for positive values. By selecting Half-Normal distributions, we can embed our model with our prior knowledge of the natural world, where we know that higher wind speeds always increase fire spread (never decrease it), so therefore our uncertainty parameter (σ) must also be positive by definition. This choice prevents our model from learning impossible relationships, like wind somehow reducing fire size. Our slope parameter (β) averages are near 0 but can only be positive, meaning we expect wind to have some positive effect on fire size. Additionally, our standard deviation (σ) parameter represents the natural variability in our predictions and stays small and positive.\n",
        "\n",
        "You might be asking why we decided to do a log-transformation of our predictor and target variables rather than using the raw data? The reason for this was to address the skew of both our variables and transform them on a logarithmic scale in an attempt to normalize the distributions. Multiplying a set of numbers on a log scale is a common practice when dealing with large deviations in a distribution, as the transformation then results in a Gaussian distribution (McElreath, 2020). If you are interested in understanding how logarithmic scales work, we suggest checking out our notes on the math behind this data transformation to gain a deeper understanding of the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, we should point out that there is a downside to this approach of having to do log-transformations on both variables due to their extremely right-skewed characteristics. This extreme skew may come back to bite us later when we generate and plot the model’s posterior inference against the data, but we’ll get into that topic later on."

So, for example, if we took a small 100 samples of our y-intercept (α) parameter and 100 samples of our slope (β) parameter, already our grid of possible linear models would result in 10,000 total combinations (100 × 100 = 10,000). However, generating a posterior distribution this way is generally NOT RECOMMENDED due to its computational load, especially as you increase the size of your sample and/or the number of parameters in your model. Having said that, the default sampling algorithm for [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/stable/learn/core_notebooks/pymc_overview.html) is the **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** method, which we’ll gloss over for now as we’ll be exploring it in more depth in a future article.\n",

For one, given that the posterior regression line remained mostly flat, it’s clear that the model believes with high confidence that wind speed has minimal predictive power over fire size. In addition, the way in which the orange cloud of sampled posterior regression lines tightly and consistently hug its mean regression is a good indication that the model is confident in its assessment of a very weak relationship between these two variables.  And the fact that our dataset contained over 150,000 instances of wildfires in BC significantly reduced the model’s uncertainty since it had an ample amount of data to train on and update its prior beliefs. Given we didn’t necessarily get the results we wanted in terms of building a model with significant predictive power over the target variable, let’s discuss a few reasons as to why this was the case in the next section and what we can do better for next time."

        "While the resulting posterior distributions seem to have produced reasonable parameter estimates *under the assumption that wind speed and fire size have a linear relationship to one another*, there are a few reasons to believe this is not actually the case. One of the key assumptions we need to make about our data when building a linear model is that the predictor and target variable must have a linear relationship to one another.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we look back at the relationship between the scatterplot and regression line in the generic Simple Linear Regression model we generated in *Figure 1* as a reference, we can see that the individual scatterpoints “hug” the regression line to a certain extent. In a true linear relationship, data points cluster around the regression line in a consistent pattern. This ideal quality for regression models is referred to as **homoscedasticity**, which describes the constant spread of residual values along the predictor variable. **Residual values** just refer to the difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, the resulting graphs from *Figures 5* and *7* don’t display these qualities despite our attempts to normalize both variables through log transformations. Instead, we see a more of a cluster towards the bottom left-hand corner of the graph, signifying that the relationship between the two tends to be non-linear due to the higher propensity for small fires throughout the province. As a result of the seemingly non-linear relationship between our predictor and target variable, we’ve already violated one of the key assumptions of linearity in regression models.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, we see evidence for the violation of another key assumption about the data when building linear regression models, which is heteroscedasticity, the opposite of homoscedasticity. We can see the evidence for **heteroscedasticity** again in *Figures 5* and *7*, where the variance of prediction errors increases at higher wind speeds rather than remaining constant. Additionally, our residuals are heavily skewed rather than normally distributed, which undermines the model's ability to predict extreme fire events - precisely the cases we most need to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "The root cause is clear: fire size follows a highly skewed distribution dominated by small fires, with occasional massive outliers. A simple linear relationship cannot capture this complexity, leaving our model poorly equipped to predict the large fires that matter most for wildfire management.\n",

        "To summarise, the underlying faults of our model are largely due to the highly skewed distributions in our dataset and the seemingly non-linear relationship between the predictor and the target variable. Therefore, a simple linear relationship cannot capture this complexity, leaving our model poorly equipped to predict the large fires that matter most for wildfire management.\n",
        "\n",
        "Having diagnosed some of the initial problems with our problem-framing, what could we do better for next time? One idea could be to add more variables and complexity by building a Multi-Linear Regression model. After all, the [wildfire dataset](https://github.com/vanislekahuna/wps-labs/tree/main/data/historical_bc_wildfires) we developed came packed with other predictor variables such as humidity levels and soil temperature. Perhaps we can also further engineer our underlying dataset to include even more features, such as topology or emergency response data, to further enrich our training data. We could have also applied techniques like polynomial regressions, which would have generated curvatures in our regression line so as to better model the nonlinear relationship of the variables. However, the risk of **overfitting** also increases where a model is too well-calibrated on the data it’s trained on and isn’t able to adapt well to new and unseen data. These are all concepts we will definitely explore in future articles!\n",
        "\n",
        "While it would have been great to build a highly performant model in our initial foray into Bayesian Linear Regression, this was still a great learning opportunity, regardless, due to the firsthand experience we gained about the complexity of modelling dynamic systems. The real world isn’t as simple as textbooks or tutorials make it out to be, especially when it comes to applying statistical machine learning models and broadening human understanding. Besides, where would the fun be if there weren’t plot twists along the way and everything was just given to us? All this is part of the learning journey, and we’re glad you came along with us during this phase of expanding our knowledge on Bayesian Regression models.\n",
