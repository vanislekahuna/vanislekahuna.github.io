        "If you’ve ever come across material that introduces Bayesian Inference, you’ll find that it usually involves an example of how misleading some medical testing devices can be in detecting diseases. Other variations of this example include using a breathalyzer to detect the amount of alcohol in the bloodstream or if we want to get creative, some fictional device that can distinguish an ordinary person from a werewolf. You get the idea. These examples involve providing the reader with a few critical variables/constants that are necessary for plugging into Bayes’ Theorem, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The prevalence of the disease in the population, which we’ll define as our **prior**, or the **probability of the hypothesis** $P(H)$:\n",
        " \t- $P(H) = 0.001$ (i.e. there is 1 person carrying the disease out of every 1,000 people)\n",
        "- The **True Positive Rate (TPR)** of the medical test, which is the probability that the device will RETURN POSITIVE, indicating that it thinks you have the disease, *given* (represented by the symbol: $\\mid$ ) the fact that you are ACTUALLY INFECTED with it:\n",
        "  - $P(E \\mid H^+) = 0.95$ (i.e. the device will correctly identify 95 out of 100 people who are carrying the disease)\n",
        "- The **False Positive Rate (FPR)** of the medical test, which is the probability that the device will RETURN POSITIVE, indicating that you have the disease, *given* the fact that you are ACTUALLY NOT INFECTED:\n",
        "  - $P(E \\mid H^-) = 0.01$ (i.e. the device will incorrectly label 1 person as infected out of 100 people who don’t carry the disease)\n",
        "\n",
        "Another key component in Bayes’ Theorem that isn’t explicitly defined, but is equally necessary to be aware of, is the **Probability of the Evidence**, also known as the **Marginal** or **Average Likelihood**. The **average likelihood** uses the **Law of Total Probability**, which states that the outcome of ALL events must equal to 1, thus quantifying the probability of the evidence being true. Its job is to standardize the posterior in order to get a probability of a certain event coming true. For example, if we’re expecting a **binomial distribution** from the posterior, such as the probability of being infected vs not infected or the probability of a coin landing on heads vs tails, we can generate the average likelihood by adding both probabilities together:\n",
        "  - $P(E) = (Pr(H) \\times Pr(E \\mid H)) + (Pr(H^-) \\times Pr(E \\mid H^-))$\n",
        "  - Note that $Pr(H^-)$, which is the probability of you NOT carrying the disease, was the only variable we didn’t provide. However, we can easily calculate it by subtracting it from 1: $Pr(H^-) = 1 - Pr(H)$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  After providing the necessary constants, the question we’re often left with to illustrate the use of Bayes’ Theorem is the following:\n",
        "  - What is the probability that you TEST POSITIVE for carrying the disease <u>given</u> the fact that you are ACTUALLY INFECTED?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  This is a trick question because most people will answer it with the TPR of the medical device (95%) without considering the disease’s prevalence in the wider population. In the case of TPR, the information it contains is kind of the opposite of the question we’re asking because TPR *assumes* that you are already infected, so it simply provides you with the probability that the medical test will identify it. So with our “trick question,” what we’re *really* asking is <u>whether or not you are actually infected with the disease</u> *after* testing positive for it. At this point, whether or not you are actually carrying the disease is still unknown and is ultimately the question we’re trying to answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "  And it’s here where the mythical **Bayes’ Theorem** is introduced as the mathematical solution which uses the evidence available to us (represented as $P(E)$) to update our prior beliefs (represented as $P(H)$), resulting in new and updated posterior beliefs. Thus, we can express the idea of **Bayes’ Theorem** using the mathematical equation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(H \\mid E) = \\frac{P(H) \\times P(E \\mid H)}{P(E)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "To those still a bit shaky with Bayesian Statistics, let’s delve a little deeper into the philosophy behind this alternative universe. **Bayesian Statistics** is what many consider to be another philosophy towards statistics and probability, which allows the practitioner to integrate their lived experience or prior knowledge towards a question they are trying to answer using data. Generally speaking, the Bayesian approach to probability posits that we can increase our understanding towards a topic of interest by updating our prior knowledge based on the evidence (i.e. the data) we come across. So the more data and information we have about our particular topic, the stronger we can cement our beliefs based on the observations we’ve experienced. In contrast, if we have a solid prior knowledge base on a topic we’re studying, it would take substantially more data/evidence to change our long-standing beliefs. In some sense, the Bayesian method of updating information closely mimics the process of [scientific inquiry](https://www.britannica.com/science/scientific-method) in using observations to form and/or update our body of knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "  And, of course, it would be remiss to at least mention how the Bayesian view of probability juxtaposes the **Frequentist view of probability** which is often the default perspective of statistics taught in schools. From the **Frequentist** perspective on probability, there is an objective ground truth to a phenomenon we’re interested in, which we get a clearer picture of as we increase our sample size. Frequentists view probability as a <u>property</u> of a repeatable event, NOT as a subjective belief or a prior hypothesis. So, for example, if we flip a coin 100 times and it lands on heads 50 times, then a Frequentist would interpret that the coin has an objective, associated property of landing on heads 50% of the time. In [contrast](https://xkcd.com/1132/) to the Bayesian approach, Frequentists do not assign probabilities to pre-existing hypotheses or models, so in some sense, they approach every problem as a blank slate. In their view, probability statements about an event or a hypothesis are either true or false based on the observed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Going back to our medical testing case study, the constants provided at the beginning represent our priors, which we’ll use to update our beliefs based on our medical test results. As we’ll often find out at the end of the demonstration, if we input the constants provided, we’ll discover that the chances of truly carrying the disease *after* our medical test indicated we were infected is actually very low:\n",

        "Now that we’ve gone through a brief overview of how Bayes’ Theorem works, let’s now try to parse out why this common example misrepresents the Bayesian interpretation of probability. One of the biggest reasons why I disagree with the common technique of highlighting Bayes’ Theorem to introduce Bayesian Statistics is because we used fixed constants (i.e. $P(H) = 0.0001$ or $TPR = 0.95$ etc.) in our example to generate our posteriors so there’s nothing uniquely “Bayesian” about it (McElreath, 2020). Simply put, the thing that distinguishes Bayesian Inference from other interpretations of probability is by its broad use of probability to generate posteriors, <u>NOT</u> by its use of Bayes Theorem (McElreath, 2020). Bayesian Inference allows us to consider a range of possible outcomes, rather than just a *single point estimate*, which is useful in situations where there is uncertainty or ambiguity about the true state of the world. To clarify, the term “**point estimates** “ is simply a Bayesian term for the “fixed constants” we defined in the beginning of our example, such as the TPR of our medical tests. **Point estimates** often come up in Bayesian literature to describe the idea of taking a *single number* to represent an *entire distribution of outcomes* can be harmful because we would lose all of the information and the nuance associated with said outcomes. Regardless of how we love to simplify things to easily fit our mental models, the worlds that we are studying are inherently messy and ambiguous. By considering the entire range of outcomes or probabilities, Bayesian Inference then allows us to make more nuanced and accurate predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "So with all that said, how can we improve the prior example to illustrate how Bayesian Inference works in the real world?  Rather than make assumptions about the probabilities of the prior (0.001) since it can be difficult to get accurate estimates of the disease’s prevalence in a population, instead we can consider a subset of possible values. And because we’re sceptical about the stated prevalence of the virus, let’s generate our own estimates using a few Python libraries, such as Numpy or Pandas. In this case, we’ll use the code to simulate the range of possible outcomes between where the disease has a low prevalence rate that infects 1 in every 10,000 people (0.0001), and a high prevalence rate that infects 1 in every 10 people (0.1). Each value we generate will serve as a prior from which we’ll map an associated posterior value."

Of course, this assumes that our medical device is indeed 95% accurate in positively diagnosing a patient who's already infected. If we were skeptical about this figure, we could also generate a list of possible values for the effectiveness of our medical device, something we can cover in later blog posts.\n",

That said, educators must not overlook taking a probabilistic approach when introducing Bayesian Statistics. Without it, newer practitioners will naturally form strong priors that Bayes' Theorem is what defines the entire field of Bayesian Statistical Inference!"
